Prologue

“We’re nearly there!” I yelled at my fellow explorers. Coal, who was the expert annoying miner, spent the last ten minutes complaining about how tired he was. Feather, the arrogant archer was shooting pigs as we walked. Dust, the redstone genius, was fidgeting with repeaters and stuff. I am the OP most awesome and handsome swordsman, ever (Cue the dramatic music). I am the one and only, Sword (Cue the explosions and the fireworks). Coal had dirty blue jeans, and a dirty shirt. He wore a diamond helmet. Feather, was a golden godlike figure, with a laurel wreath and white and gold robes. He wore no armor. Dust wore an army jacket and camo pants. I wear a tank top and shorts, plus some armor. (Full enchanted diamond)
	I saw the towering structures of rocks and dirt and lava. The pictures in the books never put this to justice. Coal started to whine:
	“Can we please set up camp and have some rest now, I’ll give you a diamond!”
	“Shut up!” Dust barked
	“My epic archery skills are rusty”, complained Feather, “I need mobs to kill!” I grabbed my diamond sword out. 
	“All of you, shut up or you will experience the pain of a sharpness five, fire aspect two, knockback two, sweeping edge three diamond sword!” I bellowed, “I think I hear something!” I thought for a moment. “We’ll go in groups of two. Each will bring one beacon and nine iron blocks, plus a red stained glass. If you need help, make a beacon pyramid with the iron and the beacon, then place the red glass on top of the beacon to make it red. And most importantly, stay alert. Ok, I’ll go with Feather. Coal and Dust, you two go together.” 
I put on my armor and took out my torches and my sword. I walked forward every so often placing a torch in front of me. Suddenly, Feather screamed,
	“Oh my god! I see a trapdoor!”
I ran to where he was, and sure enough, there was a spruce trapdoor in the ground. I placed my iron and my beacon down, and then slapped the red stained glass onto it. A beam of red light flew up. A few seconds later, Coal and Dust caught up to us. They saw the trapdoor.
	“Should we go down?” asked Dust nervously. 
	“Of course. Cause I am the bravest, awesomest swordsman ever!” I said. I ripped open the trapdoor with my super strength. Vines were leading down into a hole. I climbed down. Inside reminded me of a dungeon, except there were cobwebs everywhere and it was huge. I could hear nearby moaning and rattling. “We should split up.” I said. Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you. My fellow explorers all think of me as their leader.  I mean, I didn’t force them to, but you know, once you kill a giant hogtroll in order to save your friends, you kind of get that honor. I went to the door closest to me. I walked around a bit. I killed several slime skeletons, which are skeletons that shoot out slimes, and a zombie who was almost invincible. Suddenly, I heard Dust's voice yell:
	“Help!”. My heart started hammering. If Dust died I would never be able to live with the guilt, because I got the idea of going to the Farlands, the idea of going down the trapdoor, and splitting up. I ran to where he was by tracking his voice.
I stepped into a dark, damp musty room. The door closed behind me. I was beginning to freak out. I drew my sword and then lit a torch. No light appeared. 
	“Dust,”, I said, “are you here?”. 
	“Help.” Dust's voice croaked from somewhere in the room. I walked around using my hands to see where I was going. My hands touched something hairy. I bit back a scream. A massive spider charged at me. I stabbed it, rolled, and sliced it again. It looked unharmed. I charged at him and unleashed a deadly combo of stabbing, rolling, dashing, and slicing. It died dropping a bit of experience. Dust groaned. I walked toward his voice. When I knew I found his voice, a dim red light appeared. What I was looking at was not Dust.
	It was a pair of floating red eyes. Then everything went black.
